# Platzi Web3 Exercise

## Goal

Create a DApp that allows people to vote on a (binary) proposal. Each ethereum address should be allowed to vote only once and the vote should cost 0.01 ETH.

When a user opens the page, it should see the result so far (number of positive votes vs. number of negative votes). Real-time updating is a bonus, but not required.

The app should consist only of a frontend. It should work in GÃ¶rli and with MetaMask.

The contract is already deployed at `0xacfc7725527ba2ee4311574f65e5d76f9f9585e9`. You can see it [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xacfc7725527ba2ee4311574f65e5d76f9f9585e9#code).
