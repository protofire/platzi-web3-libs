# Ethereum Developer Program challengue #4

## Goal
Create a DApp that works with Ethers.js and Web3.js, making every functionality with both libraries, it must:
Allow to interact with a Smart Contract, listen events, listen for account change,listen for chain change. Update in real time the data every time the Smart Contract is interacted. 

## Result
### Functionalities made: 
Votes with Smart Contract defined fee, applied good transaction UX. <br/>
Listening for Vote Event and updating data. <br/>
Listening for "accountChange" and update user data. <br/>
Listening for "chainChange", and showing switch to correct chain ( Goerli ) on UI. <br/>

Every function was made in both Web3.js and Ethers.js versions, and the user can pick which one to apply.


## Stack and tools

Next.js, Ethers.js, Web3.js, SwiperJS, react switch.

Demo: https://web3-library-duality.vercel.app/

It was a truly good experience to compare the working logic of the two libraries. Definetly Ethers.js is the winner.
